## HOW CAN I MAKE A LOT ON TAKEALOT?
The Takealot marketplace is an effective, low-risk way to boost turnover by exposing your products to an extensive customer base. Now with Stock2Shop’s new Takealot connector, it’s never been easier.

As an existing client of ours, your up-to-date product information is already syncing from your accounting system onto your Stock2Shop console. For the nominal cost of a Takealot connector, we can send relevant data to the marketplace automatically. What’s more, when someone buys your products on Takealot, the order can be raised directly into your accounting system.

Here’s how to get set up:
1. Contact Takealot and list your products on their marketplace (or offer a competitive selling price on an already-listed product).
2. Once you are successfully up and running on Takealot, we update your products with important information like retail price and quantity on the Takealot marketplace.
3. When someone buys one of your products on the Takealot marketplace, Stock2Shop can raise the order directly into your accounting system.
4. f you are using a third party warehousing solution such as Parcelninja, Stock2Shop can notify them to pick, pack and deliver.

No more having to manually update your pricing and stock levels on Takealot. No more having to manually capture your Takealot orders on your accounting system. With Stock2Shop you can open up this lucrative sales channel without changing the way you operate. It’s business as usual, just better.
