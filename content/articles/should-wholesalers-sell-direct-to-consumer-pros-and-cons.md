It may seem tempting to go direct-to-consumer (DTC). With an e-commerce website, you can reach the people who want your products without going through a middleman. And you can make more profit in the process! But there is a lot to consider: essentially, moving from wholesale to retail is building a new business. It’s an entirely different strategy. Because wholesale strategies are so different to retail strategies, you may not be geared up for retail. Retail interactions depend on multichannel customer acquisition, digital marketing and a seamless customer experience – including fast fulfillment. You also need a much larger customer base as your customers won’t be placing large orders like wholesalers.

## Emerging trends in retail

More and more big brands like Nike, Adidas and L’Oreal are choosing a direct-to-consumer model. Why is that? Well, there are many Pros. Selling directly to consumers offers improved engagement with customers, ultimate control of product and better profit margins. There’s a chance for better operational efficiency as brands can predict demand with sales data straight from the customers, rather than relying on wholesalers to do their predictions for them. And the numbers are promising: sales on Nike’s own e-commerce website were up [19% in the first quarter of its fiscal 2018](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/09/29/nike-drives-deeper-direct-consumer-model/). Of course, selling directly to consumers also gives you the opportunity to gather consumer data first. As we all know, [consumer data is key](http://strategyonline.ca/2018/02/27/data-is-the-key-to-future-consumer-interaction/) to interacting smartly with customers in the future.

Nike has announced plans to grow its DTC business by [250% in the next 5 years](https://www.fungglobalretailtech.com/research/deep-dive-going-direct-consumer-way-forward-retail/), Adidas wants to quadruple its e-commerce revenue by 2020. This is not a revenue model to disregard. They are doing this through a number of online channels – their own e-commerce websites or apps, online marketplaces like Amazon, and various social media channels, as well as bricks and mortar standalone stores, pop-up stores and showrooms.
But just because big brands are following this trend doesn’t mean it’s the right choice for every brand. Acquiring customers for direct retail sales costs a lot of money, as does ensuring fulfillment, returns and customer service. While online marketplaces often cover the payment, customer service and fulfillment side of things for a brand, the downside is that you don’t get the customer data from the sales, and you generally have no say over how your brand is presented.

## Retail and wholesale, side by side

Some brands opt to sell retail and wholesale, side by side. They keep their wholesale customers and also sell direct to consumers, thereby reducing the need for marketing spend as their retailers are still marketing their products. This is definitely an option, as long as you remember one golden rule: don’t undercut your retailers. If you are selling exactly the same products as your retailers, you either need to sell for exactly the same price or (if you want to keep them happy), sell for a slightly higher price. The other option is to only offer a limited selection of items, while your retailers stock the full selection. If you are tempted to sell both retail and wholesale, it’s important to recognize that you will be balancing two different kinds of customers, both sharing the same inventory. At some stage you will need to decide which is more important to you: wholesale or retail?

## Questions to ask if you’re considering selling DTC
