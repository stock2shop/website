When changes are made to your Parcel Ninja Inventory, we can set an hourly time to check for changes.
This can be set for which ever minute on the hour best suits your workflow.

### Process Orders from Webstore
If you are using an FTP server to Host your Spreadsheet field, we can setup your integation to process Orders to your FTP server.

### Sync Images with Product data
If you have Image URLs they can be included in your Flat File setup to Sync once the Products are in Stock2Shop.
The Products go be sent from Stock2Shop to your Webstore with the Images associated.

### Sync specific Product data 
We can update Product data as needed from a Spreadsheet file. You can tell us which columns are relevant to sync to Stock2Shop.
