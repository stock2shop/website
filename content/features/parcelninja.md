### Update Stock2Shop hourly with Product data changes
When changes are made to your Parcel Ninja Inventory, we can set an hourly time to check for changes.
This can be set for which ever minute on the hour best suits your workflow.

<!-- product_field_map -->
### Map Product data into Stock2Shop
You can decide on which fields you want to pull into Stock2Shop that are available on Parcel Ninja.
There is very little product data with Parcel Ninja, so additional data will need to be added at a later point.

<!-- create_order_enabled -->
### Process Fulfillments when Orders are placed
When Orders are placed on your Website, they will process to Stock2Shop and if required, can be automatically fulfilled.
Once fulfilled, the Inventory will update Stock2Shop with the new Stock Balance.

<!-- default_contact_number -->
### Contact Number for Orders
We can set a contact number for Orders if not provided by the Customer.
This could be your Contact number if needed.
