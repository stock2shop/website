Sage Business Cloud Accounting is an online accounting system. 
This means the application lives in the “cloud”. Enabling Stock2Shop to work with 
Sage Business Cloud Accounting is relatively simple. In order for Stock2Shop to 
provide you with the full integration features and link your Sage Business Cloud Accounting system 
to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as 
Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, 
Parcelninja and Takealot, we need access to your Sage Business Cloud Accounting account.
Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Sage Business Cloud Accounting integration from start to finish.
