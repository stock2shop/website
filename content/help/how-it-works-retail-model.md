You have a retail business that sells online via your e-commerce website to customers.

### Traditional Retail Model 
Traditionally, your organisation would have an [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and an e-commerce website.
In most instances, there would be very little to no integration between the two systems. 
They would operate independently and have to be manually updated by someone within your organisation.

All product information, including product description, options, pricing and quantities 
would have to be manually exported from your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and imported into your e-commerce website.

Once you have all your product information on your e-commerce website, and sales start coming in
you will again have to export the sales information in the form of orders and manually import them
into your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations). Thereafter another manual request must be made to fulfil the order.

This approach is a problematic for several reasons:

1. Manual intervention between the two systems can result in stock and price discrepancies.
2. Product prices and quantities on the e-commerce website may not always be up to date
3. potentially oversell products due to inventory discrepancies
4. Having to capture order information in the [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) can be a laborious task.

### New Retail Model
Inventory and product information can be synced to your [e-commerce website](/integrations) sales channel 
from your ERP / Accounting system and orders from your e-commerce website are automatically raised as sales orders
and converted to invoices in your ERP / Accounting system. 

This approach is a beneficial for several reasons:
1. Little to no manual intervention between your ERP / Accounting system and your e-commerce website.
2. As soon as orders are placed and paid for, they are sent to your ERP / Accounting system. 
3. Automatic inventory and product updates sent from your ERP / Accounting system to your e-commerce website.
4. Notifications automatically sent to your 3rd party fulfillment service to deliver orders.

This is a rudimentary example of how Stock2Shop can accommodate the retail model. 
In this example, Stock2Shop has reduced the administration requirements and processing time for the company, 
ensured that inventory, product and order data is correctly captured. 
Stock2Shop is highly customisable and there are many different configuration options for each of the steps above.
