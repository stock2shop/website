### Enriching Products

There are many workflows for enriching your Product data, you can enrich the Product fully and Sync it to 
Stock2Shop with all relevant info or if your Source does not cover all fields you wish to update, you can enrich your
Products in Stock2shop. Below is a breakdown of the options for enriching Products:

- **Import**: Using the Import feature, you can update existing Products in Stock2Shop and all available fields. To do 
  this, all that is needed is a CSV file with all column headers to be the required field names in Stock2Shop, and the 
  relevant Product Codes. Check out [Importing Products](/help/how-to/products/import)
  
- **Add**: Products can be added manually to Stock2Shop and during this process, all required fields can be updated, and 
  the product will be enriched on creation. This Product will not be updated by your Source unless the sme code exists 
  on your ERP. You can Add Products by Hovering over the Product Tab in the Console, and select 
  **[Add](https://console.stock2shop.com/console/#/products/add)**.
  
- **Edit**: Once your source has loaded the Product data into Stock2Shop, you can manually edit each product as required.

- **Linked Source**: Connect a secondary asource used for updating certain fields that cannot be populated by your ERP.
