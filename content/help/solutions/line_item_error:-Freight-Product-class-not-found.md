<!-- Action: sync_order -->
#### Error description
When raising an order in Syspro, a non existent shipping line item is being added which causes the order to fail.


#### Error solution
You will need to create a service line item in Syspro for shipping, if not already created. Provide Stock2Shop with the item code for the service line item. Stock2Shop will then add it as a parameter to your source configuration.

param_shipping_code:  (Service line item SKU)

You will then need to retry the failed order.
