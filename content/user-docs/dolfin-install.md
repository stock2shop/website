## Introduction
Dolfin is an online accounting system. This means the application lives in the “cloud”. Enabling Stock2Shop to work with Dolfin is relatively simple. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration features and link your Dolfin system to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, Parcelninja and Takealot, we need access to your Dolfin.

## For accessing your data
In order to communicate with Dolfin, we require the following information:

- Product Request URL
- Order Request URL
- Company ID
- Username
- Password

This information will be provided to Stock2Shop by your Dolfin representative.
